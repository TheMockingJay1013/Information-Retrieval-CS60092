For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt  but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year . As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015  some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk . The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2 300 milligrams  with an even stricter 1 500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50 . In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit  although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50  reports The Washington Post .  So why are we still scaring people about salt  . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine .

Jack Grealish  left  has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera inhaling nitrous oxide  . Grealish starred for Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi final win over Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley  . At Arsenal  Arsene Wenger changed the attitude completely .

You eat what s required to refuel  not for pleasure . Of course you still get players who want to enjoy themselves but there has to be a cut off point .

 CNN You know the phrase  dodging a bullet  . Forget about it . Probably not going to happen anymore . The U S  military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self steering bullet . In February  the  smart bullets      50 caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors    passed their most successful round of live fire tests to date  according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  or DARPA . In the tests  an experienced marksman  repeatedly hit moving and evading targets   a DARPA statement said .  Additionally   the statement said   a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target  . In other words  now you don t even have to be a good shot to hit the mark . The system has been developed by DARPA s Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program  known as EXACTO . Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets . It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes . Only  these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour . And even the Road Runner can t run that fast .

Melbourne  Australia  CNN A man stands on a beach in a distant land . Waves lap his ankles . He wades through the gentle dawn light  arms outstretched  his head held high . He is fully dressed  not a tourist but a freedom fighter . A photograph of this man  beamed around the world  becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty . It is 2015 . The man is Peter Greste . If you thought the man might have been an Anzac on the shores of Gallipoli  such is the power of persuasion . It s easy to lead a horse to water when  in the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign  our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance . There is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead . More objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game . But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder . Australia s participation in the war was contested from the outset . Most protest meetings were peaceful  but one became infamously violent . Both conscription referendums ultimately failed . Other protesters were deported . Copyright 2015 The Conversation .

Surely President Barack Obama s climate plan  allegedly aimed at reducing the United States  overall carbon emissions  would revitalize the nuclear industry  lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets . Well  think again . James Hansen  the former head of NASA s Goddard Institute for Space Studies  said in 2013 that  continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change  . Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon free  the Obama administration s energy policy plan is biased against it . This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation . EPA s modeling is divorced from reality . EPA s implementation modeling   Option 1    State    shows exactly the same situation  no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050 . Where did this policy shift come from .

He suggested that the success of so called SSRI drugs   which include Prozac and Seroxat   was based on the  marketing of a myth  . Scroll down for video  .

George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country s top earners  . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor s admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government s priorities . George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country s top earners  offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than  50 000 could see the rate lowered . Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax free personal allowance bracket from  10 000 to  12 500 . Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least  50 000 was also a priority  he said . At present anyone earning between  31 866 to  150 000 is taxed at the higher rate . Those earning above  150 000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent . But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket .

 CNN This is a difficult but necessary thing to say  Incidents of police involved killings and assaults on unarmed African Americans are unlikely to end soon . That s partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a  moment  . And it s also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it . This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis . The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis    as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over . The violent response of police officers to unarmed African Americans is a decades long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as  race card  politics and black grievance . So what makes now different . The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system . How do we face this crisis . First  we must recognize that there are no quick fixes . To subvert that culture will require vigorous  targeted and consistent training . And it s true that his options are limited . How . That must change . They undoubtedly exist .

 CNN The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne  Switzerland  on Thursday that limits Iran s nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . Expect pushback anyway  if the recent past is any harbinger . Just last month  in an attempt to head off such an agreement  House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress  and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal . The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . Let us address some of these   . That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U S  Congress . But that is not and never was the objective . If it had been  there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table . The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . Again  this is not the case . This provision will be permanent . It does not sunset .

Google is already the world s most popular phone software provider  and a pay TV operator   and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier . The company has unveiled a U S  wireless service that switches between Wi Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low .

Most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money . Scroll down for video  .

 CNN Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism    real or perceived    to advance executions  Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty .  The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year   said Salil Shetty  Amnesty s Secretary General in a release .  It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people s lives    putting people to death for  terrorism  or to quell internal instability on the ill conceived premise of deterrence  . The report   Death Sentences and Executions 2014   cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December . On one hand  the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22  on the previous year . At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014  compared to 778 in 2013 . Belarus and Vietnam  too  do not release data on death penalty cases .  There are  signals of a world that is nearing abolition  . Opinion  Sharp spike in death sentences  .

 CNN By now  you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana s religious freedom law . You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians  using religion as a cover . Or  like Indiana Gov . Mike Pence  you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states . The issue drives a wedge because  well  the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated  but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned . Whichever side you re on  here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy . These points might not change your mind  but offer context to better understand the uproar .  That may be true only if you re using a Funhouse mirror   Schumer wrote on his Facebook page . The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom  he contends . This is how it could make a difference   . Would the outcome have been the same . They lost the case .

For a start  no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick off were English . Of those  10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free kick  . Ticket prices . Entry was free and close to 1 000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half and half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham s compact 6 000 capacity home may not be Old Trafford  but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United s Carrington complex  where Paul McGuinness s Under 18s usually ply their trade . In an even first half the impressive Marcus Wood  from just down the road in Sale  came closest for City with an audacious chip .

Foreign GPs now account for 11 per cent of family doctors  new figure show  . The number of GPs from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the NHS tries to combat a shortage of staff .

Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22 0 per cent of current GPs gained their qualifications overseas  up from 19 8 per cent in 2004  . But the figure is 71 per cent in Barking and Dagenham  east London  63 per cent in Medway  Kent  and 58 per cent in North Lincolnshire . The NHS is facing a shortage because many GPs are retiring early . Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions . The NHS employs 40 584 GPs  of whom 8 941 are from overseas . This is up from 6 921 in 2004 when there were 34 855 family doctors in total .

While young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely  it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves . Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory . They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda  the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing . Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda  above  have learned to look for traffic  . Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads  while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely . It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads . Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs  researchers have suggested . They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes  different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments . However  the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat  suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead .  More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing .  Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups .

Toure  for example  left home as a teenager to play in the Belgian second division . Following that came some formative years playing for Metalurh Donetsk in eastern Ukraine . History also tells us that Toure  now almost 32  never stays in one place too long . Equally  though  Toure s rather clumsy statements of recent times should not be allowed to detract from his legacy at City and indeed in the Barclays Premier League . It looks likely Yaya Toure may leave Manchester City this summer but his legacy should be a positive one  . Toure has struggled to impose himself upon games for City in the manner seen in previous seasons  . Toure s time at City is defined as a success  bringing two Premier League titles to the Etihad  . It looks extremely likely that he will leave England this summer . He replied   Yes  Yaya . The plan was straight forward .  I love Mario   he said .

Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott  but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened .

The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain .  This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain   said Professor Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne  EPFL  in Switzerland  . Blindfolded and wearing ear plugs  test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device . Behind them  the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back . When conducted in real time  the participant s brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement .

Now scientists believe they have found evidence of what may lie behind  the gift of the gab  . Brain scans on a group of professional comedians has revealed differences in the way the brains of these  super speakers  work while talking . The ultimate wheeler dealer  Del Boy s gift of the gab came from a difference in the way his brain worked  . Compared to the less silver tongued among us  the super speakers   which also included a barrister and a radio presenter   showed less activity in a key area of the brain involved articulating and comprehending speech . This suggests that this group were putting less effort into the basic mechanics of speech  allowing them to devote more resources to what they were going to say next . Neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic . The findings may also help to explain why some people dry up completely when asked to speak . There s been almost no interest in how speech goes right  .

Dongguan  China  CNN For a decade  the New South China Mall    the biggest shopping mall in the world    has been an embarrassment for its owners and China . Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country  the goal was to attract 100 000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment  shops and eateries . Outside the mall  a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas . It even boasted an indoor roller coaster . But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came . Soon  it was classified by industry analysts as a  dead mall  and it became an unflattering symbol of China s runaway speculation on real estate projects . When I visited two years ago  the mall was deserted . Most units were empty . Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded . The occupancy rate was less than 10  . It was a walk through a ghost mall . However  a visit in late March revealed a different picture . The mall was buzzing with activity .  It s been a big change .

A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the Central Valley and to millions of residents as far south as San Diego . Delta farmers don t deny using as much water as they need . But they say they re not stealing it because their history of living at the water s edge gives them that right . Still  they have been asked to report how much water they re pumping and to prove their legal rights to it . Scroll down for video  . Gov . Jerry Brown has said that if drought continues this system built into California s legal framework will probably need to be examined .

 CNN I m haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police    his back turned to the officer . What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body . I understand why people are skeptical of self defense claims    especially from law enforcement . If not for the video taken by a bystander  I can t help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation . Thank God there was a camera . It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case . However  there is another camera that    had it been deployed    might have prevented the entire tragedy  a police body camera . Throughout the entire encounter with Scott  it s clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him . Would he have fired . Eight times . Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report . Of course not . Body cameras are expensive to deploy  sure . Certainly it s worth the price of some mass data storage .
